Quantum Key Distribution with Java code

# prerequisites
The samples in this repository use Java 17 or later. If you already
have a JDK 17 install, you're good.
To make it really easy to run the samples, there are a number of
`jbang` scripts. Go to [jbang.dev]https://jbang.dev to learn about jbang
and how to install it.
